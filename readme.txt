Antigen Classification by Jeffrey Hurst

For Birbeck MSc Bioinformatic project.
----------------------------------------------

These are the perl scripts and raw results created by the classifiers.

The Test and Training sets contain the database file split.

DictionaryRule, Bayes and SVM contains the scripts and the results. The SVM and Bayes folders are further split down for the syllable and word methods.

Hyphenation contains the modified TeX file and scripts used. 

Modules needed are:

Util::List
Algorithm::NaiveBayes
TeX::Hyphenation
(all available from CPAN)

Also LibSVM, I used the standalone Windows executeables which can be downloaded (as part of the whole package) from:
